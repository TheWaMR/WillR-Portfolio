How to use hugo:
open VSCode & type cd WillR_Portfolio to pput the terminal
in that folder. you may need to do cd C:\ then cd Hugo/WillR_Portfolio

Then, make edits to the markdown files in the content folder
then use hugo server -D to post the server with the draft pages included

Ctrl + C to stop the server, Ctrl + S to reload (if any changes were made)

STILL NEED TO FIGURE OUT:
use "hugo new posts/[folder]/index.md" to add a new page in a new folder
i.e. hugo new posts/RPS/index.md

**BEFORE I ADD ANY OF THESE:
I SHOULD GO INTO CONFIG.TOML AND ADD DEFAULT AUTHOR / AVATAR / other things
https://hugo-theme-dream.g1en.site/params-configurations#:~:text=author%20%3D%20%22g1eny0ung,%E4%B8%8D%E5%A6%82%E9%A9%AC%E4%B8%8A%E5%87%BA%E5%8F%91%E3%80%82%22


C:\Hugo\WillR_Portfolio\themes\hugo-theme-dream-master\config.toml
that's to edit params and stuff

hugo new posts/Alarmclock/index.md
hugo new posts/PC/index.md
hugo new posts/Battery_Charger/index.md
hugo new posts/Plasma_Cutter/index.md
hugo new posts/LF3DP/index.md
hugo new posts/Photography/index.md
hugo new posts/A4988/index.md


then put images in the folder (this is called a branch)

Use # to create a heading (regular markdown stuff), this will separate 
the preview section of the page from everything else

also i added 3 lines to themes > hugo-theme-dream-master > layouts > _default > baseof.html > lines 77-79
Remove this if i find a better way to add navigation back to home screen

This is my first post to this website. There are a lot of things I'm figuring out all at once. I'm not a software developer, but it's probably good for me to be able to do this. Most of the heavy lifting (coding wise) was done by people much smarter than me, but I still am putting in a bit of effort to figure this all out, and get it looking the way I want it to. 

Honestly I think the hardest part will be retrospectively going back and figuring out dates for all my project work. I *had* a google sites portfolio, but it was really limited in customization & formatting. As such I never really put any effort into documenting the things that I worked on, and now I'm wishing I had. I did some noteworthy things, and I want to be able to have one place where I can show it off. 

Also I will eventually be rolling out new images, as I get better pictures for my projects. Some old breadboard projects obviously don't exist anymore, so reshoots are impossible, but I will try to get more visually-pleasing images for some of my old PCB projects.
