# USA Total Solar Eclipse 4/8/25
{{< details "Read about Solar Eclipse">}} 
After sleeping through the October 14th 2023 total solar eclipse (oops), I committed myself to witnessing the April 8th, 2024 one. In the weeks leading up to the event, I bought a 4"x4" square of solar filter with the intention of not only seeing it, but getting some cool pictures of it. In the days leading up, my mom and little brother informed me of their plans to go see it as well, wanting to go up to Waco, TX to see totality (and also so they could tour the Baylor university campus). 

### Setup
Pictured below are images of the camera setup (Canon Rebel T3i + EF-S 55-250mm lens), and myself using the camera during the event. (In the chair behind me is my little brother, who is now attending Baylor University!)

In total, the partial eclipse lasted for 2 hours 40 mins, and the totality event lasted slightly over 4 mins [Event details from Waco, TX](https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/map/2024-april-8?n=usa%2Fwaco). Before totality, I took pictures about every 20 minutes to create a collage of the eclipse as it grew and grew.

During totality, every one of the 252 seconds counted, because an event like this would not happen in the contiguous USA until August 12, **2045** [Source](https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/solar/2045-august-12). During this time, I took a few seconds to get some other pictures, one from my iPhone 13 Pro camera, and one of the surrounding area. I was kinda stressing about getting good pictures, and after about 3 minutes of continuous picture taking, I put everything down and enjoyed the rest of the event with my own eyes, and the people around me.

Another shot I prepared for was one of the surrounding area. I knew that during totality it was supposed to get dark, but I wanted to capture the extent to which that happened. To do this, I grabbed an image about 90 mins before totality, and one during. I was really careful in making sure that the framing was as close as possible (I used the camp chairs as a guide).

## 2017 Great American Solar Eclipse
The last solar eclipse I had witnessed was the one on August 21, 2017, on a class day while I was in middle school. It was a partial solar eclipse from Houston, and the school let us observe it for about 10 minutes before having to go back inside for classes. At the time I had my iPhone 5s and some solar glasses, and tried to get a picture of the event. The crescent shape on the left image (2017) is barely visible, whereas the image on the right (2024) shows the eclipse in its entirety with magnitudes more detail. 

From the picture metadata, the image in 2017 was taken at 1:25pm, which according to [timeanddate](https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/in/usa/houston?iso=20170821#:~:text=72.0%C2%B0-,13%3A29*,-Mon%2C%20Aug%2021), should have put the approximate sun coverage at roughly 64%. On a personal note, the eclipse looked more dramatic in person than what my phone was able to capture.

In 2017 I actually brought the same canon camera with me, but I didn't have the required solar filter, and I was nervous about pointing my family's camera right at the sun with no protection.

## The Great Conjunction of Saturn & Jupiter
Dec 21, 2020
During this time, the two planets were separated by only 6 arc-minutes. This is the closest they've ever been since 1623, and won't happen again until 2040 (by which time I'd like to be prepared to take better pictures)
