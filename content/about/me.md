Howdy!

I am William Rohren, and I am a junior Mechanical Engineering Major at Texas A&M University.
This site serves as a portfolio to display my various projects, as well as a blog so that I
can have a log of the things I do. 

I currently am a student worker for the Rapid Prototyping Studio within the MEEN department of A&M. Any posts/projects tagged with 'RPS' represent things I have done while working at the RPS. 

I've done markdown with the RPS, but setting that up is entirely new to me.
